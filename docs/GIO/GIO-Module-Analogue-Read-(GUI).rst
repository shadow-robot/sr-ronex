The best way to analyse data from an analogue input channel in the GUI
is to use the Plot plugin, which will allow you to display the data in a
graphical manner.

Once you've opened the Plot plugin you can then enter the name of the
topic you want to display, the topic name will auto complete, but you'll
have to add the name of the data field on the end manually (e.g.
analogue[0]).
