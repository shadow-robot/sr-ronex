/**
 * @file   cod_decod_manager.hpp
 * @author Toni Oliver <toni@shadowrobot.com>
 * @brief  An instance of this class will be created by the driver of every ethercat slave.
 *         Depending on the configuration read from the parameter server (defined in 
 *         cod_decod_config.yaml) It will instantiate an object of the corresponding subclass of 
 *         CodDecod. The update and build_command functions will call the corresponding functions 
 *         of the CodDecod object.
