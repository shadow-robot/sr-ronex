 * @author Toni Oliver <toni@shadowrobot.com>
 * @brief  This is the parent class for the actual CodDecod objects for every ethercat slave device.
 *         The main functions are update, which decodes the data buffer coming from the ethercat device 
 *         and updates the fields of the HardwareInterface, and build_command, which encodes the command 
 *         data for the ethercat device (reading from HardwareInterface) and writes it to the buffer.
